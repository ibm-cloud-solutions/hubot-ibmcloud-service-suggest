CloudAMQP is offered by:,CloudAMQP
To access CloudAMQP from Perl you can use Net::RabbitMQ.,CloudAMQP
"The following code snippet show how to connect, publish and consume a message via CloudAMQP.",CloudAMQP
"A simple php class that can be used to connect, publish and subscribe from CloudAMQP MQTT is phpMQTT.",CloudAMQP
When you create a CloudAMQP instance are all the common protocols available by default (the web-stomp plugin/WebSockets is only enabled on dedicated plans).,CloudAMQP
Getting started guides on CloudAMQP and our language documentation shows sample code using RabbitMQ with the AMQP protocol.,CloudAMQP
"The following code connects to CloudAMQP, declares a queues, publish a message to it, setups a subscription and print messages coming to the queue.",CloudAMQP
"// AppSettings[""CLOUDAMQP_URL""] contains the connection string",CloudAMQP
// when you've added the CloudAMQP Addon,CloudAMQP
Imagen that you have a CloudAMQP instance with very high load on queue A. In that case you can create a shovel and configure it to consume the messages from queue A and republish them to an exchange in another CloudAMQP instance.,CloudAMQP
The image below show a simple example where all the messages that are published to the exchange on the the CloudAMQP instance will be copied to the RabbitMQ exchange set up on localhost.,CloudAMQP
This should be the full CloudAMQP URI,CloudAMQP
"If you need highly available message queues, a perfect choice would be to use CloudAMQP.",CloudAMQP
CloudAMQP is hosted RabbitMQ servers (message queues) that lets you pass messages between processes and other systems.,CloudAMQP

All CloudAMQP instances has the Stomp plugin enabled by default on port 61613 (TLS: 61614).,CloudAMQP
Below you see an sample app which both publish and subscribes to CloudAMQP MQTT.,CloudAMQP
CloudAMQP is a service you can add to your app in Bluemix.,CloudAMQP
"A complete getting started guide can be found here, RabbitMQ message queueing with CloudAMQP on Bluemix.",CloudAMQP
Instance information such as username and password can be found in the Control Panel from CloudAMQP.,CloudAMQP
"Once the service is added to space, a link to CloudAMQP Control Panel will appear within Bluemix.",CloudAMQP
CloudAMQP offers various monitoring tools.,CloudAMQP
"It shows how to build a simple real time application, using CloudAMQP as the backbone.",CloudAMQP
"If you have any questions, please feel free to contact support@cloudamqp.com for further assistance.",CloudAMQP
To access CloudAMQP (or any RabbitMQ/AMQP server) from PHP php-amqplib is a good choice.,CloudAMQP
A full example can be found here: github.com/cloudamqp/web-stomp-example,CloudAMQP
The async em-mqtt library need to support user/password before it's usable with CloudAMQP MQTT protocol.,CloudAMQP
In the following code snippet you can see how to publish and subscribe from CloudAMQP MQTT.,CloudAMQP
"(def url (get (System/getenv) ""CLOUDAMQP_URL"" ""amqp://guest:guest@localhost""))",CloudAMQP
It is enabled by default on all CloudAMQP instances and assigned port 443.,CloudAMQP
The sample code below show how to set up a connection to CloudAMQP and how to set up a listener for messages.,CloudAMQP
"The code below is build upon the example given in the example folder for the lib, amqp_listen.c, additional information is added to show how to set up the CloudAMQP credentials.",CloudAMQP
Add the namespace RabbitMQ.Client to your file and create a ConnectionFactory Set the URI to the CloudAMQP url.,CloudAMQP
// Create a ConnectionFactory and set the Uri to the CloudAMQP url,CloudAMQP
CloudAMQP monitoring include diagrams for CPU and Memory usage.,CloudAMQP
It is possible to activate alarms to be triggered when a part of the system is heavily used and it is easy to view the RabbitMQ log stream direcly in CloudAMQP.,CloudAMQP
"The instance details, such as connection URL, server name and password can be seen at the details page directly after your CloudAMQP instance has been created.",CloudAMQP
Webhooks (push-queues) can be set up from the console page of CloudAMQP.,CloudAMQP
CloudAMQP is an add-on providing RabbitMQ as a service.,CloudAMQP
"All AMQP client libraries work with CloudAMQP and there's AMQP client libraries for almost every platform out there, including Ruby, Node.js, Java, Python, Clojure and Erlang.",CloudAMQP
CloudAMQP can be installed to a Heroku application via the CLI:,CloudAMQP
"-----> Adding cloudamqp to sharp-mountain-4005... done, v18 (free)",CloudAMQP
Once CloudAMQP has been added a CLOUDAMQP_URL setting will be available in the app configuration and will contain the canonical URL used to access the RabbitMQ cluster.,CloudAMQP
"If you have multiple CloudAMQP instances, you need to check in the app configuration for correct URL for the App.",CloudAMQP
"The CloudAMQP dashboard allows you to show the current message rate, which queues and exchanges you have, and the bindings between them.",CloudAMQP

Ensure that your dialog file contains the opening and closing <dialog> tags.,Dialog
The following information describes the most commonly used dialog nodes.,Dialog
A concept node is used by the Dialog service to replace a specific word with the words in the list.,Dialog
"With this concept in place, submitted questions like What is a VA?, What is a Digital Agent? and What is a dialogbot? are matched to the input What is a Virtual Agent?, and the appropriate response is given because the system uses the concept node to know that the words all mean the same thing.",Dialog
Concepts are used to expand variations for every node on a dialog level.,Dialog
They are all stored in the Concepts folder because they are active in the dialog flow no matter where they are placed.,Dialog
"If you specify GIDs, ensure that the values throughout the dialog document are unique.",Dialog
"Otherwise, the dialog document cannot be imported into the system.",Dialog
The scope of the GID is the dialog ID.,Dialog
The <classifier> node enables the dialog to use classifier-based matching of user input in all <search> nodes.,Dialog
The What's in Theaters application uses IBM Watson Dialog service to show the best practices for building a conversational application.,Dialog
"While the UI is rendering within the browser, a subsequent REST API request to initialize a conversation with the Dialog service is sent to the application server tier.",Dialog
"Then, the application server code acts as a proxy, looks up the application's credentials (VCAP_VARIABLES) and makes a request to the Dialog service to initialize a new chat.",Dialog
"If the request is successful, the Dialog service returns at minimum three pieces of information, a client id, a conversation id, and an initial 'welcome' message.",Dialog

Apache TinkerPop is a graph computing framework for both graph databases (OLTP) and graph analytic systems (OLAP).,IBM Graph
A graph is a structure composed of vertices and edges.,IBM Graph
"Together, the aforementioned graph is known as a property graph and it is the foundational data structure of Apache TinkerPop.",IBM Graph
"If a user's domain is composed of a heterogenous set of objects (vertices) that can be related to one another in a multitude of ways (edges), then a graph may be the right representation to use.",IBM Graph
"In a graph, each vertex is seen as an atomic entity (not simply a ""row in a table"") that can be linked to any other vertex or have properties added or removed at will.",IBM Graph
"Graph computing has a rich history that includes not only query languages devoid of table-join semantics, but also algorithms that support complex reasoning: path analysis, vertex clustering and ranking, subgraph identification, and more.",IBM Graph
"The world of applied graph computing offers a flexible, intuitive data structure along with a host of algorithms able to effectively leverage that structure.",IBM Graph
"Apache TinkerPop is an open source, vendor-agnostic, graph computing framework distributed under the commercial friendly Apache2 license.",IBM Graph
"When a data system is TinkerPop-enabled, its users are able to model their domain as a graph and analyze that graph using the Gremlin graph traversal language.",IBM Graph
IBM Graph provides an HTTP API for manipulating and querying graphs.,IBM Graph
"For example, if your apiURL is https://graphrestify-alpha.ng.bluemix.net/8c0a807c-b9b5-4a11-b872-6f92826ee41d/g/, the session URL is https://graphrestify-alpha.ng.bluemix.net/8c0a807c-b9b5-4a11-b872-6f92826ee41d/_session.",IBM Graph

"The blockchain monitor displays network details, live logs, current ledger state, APIs, and chaincode templates.",Blockchain
Consensus Test 1 tests the PBFT consensus protocol in a blockchain network scenario where none of the four nodes are Byzantine: none of the nodes have gone offline in an arbitrary and concurrent manner.,Blockchain
"d. If this is the first operation against the blockchain, then the chain height is 1, because the only block on the chain is the genesis block.",Blockchain
"The fabric is an implementation of blockchain technology, leveraging familiar and proven technologies.",Blockchain
The following architecture diagram illustrates how the IBM Secure Service Container and blockchain appliances are organized:,Blockchain
"It brings the advanced cryptography, security, and reliability of the z Systems LinuxONE platform to blockchain services for handling sensitive and regulated data.",Blockchain
The IBM Secure Service Container provides the following optimized security functions for blockchain services:,Blockchain
System administrators have the following limitations when blockchain is secured by the IBM Secure Service Container:,Blockchain
"To manage blockchain assets via REST APIs, you can use the Swagger UI on Blockchain dashboard on Bluemix or REST commands tools, such as curl or Postman.",Blockchain
"The blockchain software within the secure boot can be signed, attested, and encrypted; and once installed in the application container, is tamper-resistant.",Blockchain
The PBFT protocol guarantees that a blockchain network with N peers will continue to function if no more than (N-1)/3 peers go offline in a Byzantine (arbitrary and concurrent) manner.,Blockchain
"Your bluemix blockchain network has four peers, so if two peers crash, the network will NOT execute any transactions or append any blocks to the ledger.",Blockchain
"d. If this is the first operation against the blockchain, the chain height is 1 because the only block on the chain is the genesis block.",Blockchain
A Node SDK allows for client-side Node.js applications to interact with the blockchain.,Blockchain
Member - An identity for participating in the blockchain network.,Blockchain
Spin up a test blockchain network in one click,Blockchain
"IBM Blockchain networks are built on the notion of decentralized control, but some cloud environments leave back doors open to vulnerabilities.",Blockchain
"Working with teams of security experts, cryptographers, hardware experts and researchers, IBM has created essential new cloud services for tamper-resistant, trusted blockchain networks.",Blockchain
"Spin up a test blockchain network in one click  spend less time worrying about building and managing the network, and focus more time on developing your applications.",Blockchain

Use chaincode to programmatically deploy smart contracts and business logic within the blockchain.,Blockchain
"Both the REST API and CLI were utilized to test all endpoint functions, including Block, Blockchain, Chaincode, Network, Registrar, and Transactions, as described in the Hyperledger Protocol Specification.",Blockchain
"To get started, follow these steps to create and deploy an unbound service instance of a {{site.data.keyword.blockchain}} network.",Blockchain
"Your Bluemix blockchain environment has four peers, so if one peer crashes, the network will continue to run consensus and append transactions to the ledger.",Blockchain
"Applying the PBFT formula reveals that (4-1)/3 = 1 = number of Byzantine nodes, so transaction processing on the blockchain network continues.",Blockchain
A previously Byzantine peer that has since rejoined a blockchain network will detect that its copy of the ledger lags behind that of the other peers.,Blockchain
Both the Developer Network and the High Security Business Network plans enable you to test the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus protocol on a four-node blockchain network.,Blockchain
"Consensus is a method for validating the order of network requests, or transactions (deploy and invoke), on a blockchain network.",Blockchain
"On a blockchain network, there is no single authority that determines the transaction order; instead, each blockchain node (or peer) has an equal say in establishing the order, by implementing the network consensus protocol.",Blockchain
"In other words, consensus guarantees the integrity and consistency of blockchain network transactions.",Blockchain
"Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) is one of various consensus protocols which maintain the order of transactions on a blockchain network, despite threats to this order.",Blockchain
"Using PBFT, a blockchain network of (N) nodes can withstand (f) number of Byzantine nodes, where f = (N-1)/3.",Blockchain
The enhanced Node.js SDK allows application developers to build Node.js applications that can interact with an existing blockchain.,Blockchain
"The client SDK provides APIs through which an application can interact with a Hyperledger blockchain, and those APIs are designed to support two pluggable components.",Blockchain
What is blockchain?,Blockchain
"Blockchain is a technology for a new generation of transactional applications that establishes trust, accountability and transparency, while streamlining business processes.",Blockchain
"With blockchain, we can reimagine the most fundamental business exchanges, and open the door to a new world of digital interactions.",Blockchain
Blockchain has the potential to vastly reduce the cost and complexity of cross-enterprise business processes.,Blockchain
"For example, blockchain networks allow securities trades to be settled in minutes, instead of days.",Blockchain
"Blockchain can also help companies streamline the flow of goods and payments, and enable manufacturers to reduce product recalls by easily sharing production logs with Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and regulators.",Blockchain
The following terms are instrumental in gaining a holistic understanding of blockchain concepts:,Blockchain
"In addition to data from previous transactions, the ledger (blockchain) also contains the data for currently-running chaincode applications.",Blockchain
Sample applications and tutorials for IBM Blockchain demonstrate how fundamental applications and chaincodes function in a blockchain network.,Blockchain
"To learn more about the fabric code that is underpinning your blockchain network, visit the Docs section of the Linux Foundation's Hyperledger Project.",Blockchain

Training for Language Translation Model always fails,Language Translation
"To use the GA customization features (the Trainable plan) of the Language Translation service with a Bluemix application that uses an earlier instance of the service, complete the following steps:",Language Translation
The Watson Language Translation service provides domain-specific translation utilizing Statistical Machine Translation techniques that have been perfected in our research labs over the past few decades.,Language Translation
Examples of where Watson Language Translation could be used include: An English-speaking help desk representative assists a Spanish-speaking customer through a chat session that is translated in real-time.,Language Translation
All the above examples can benefit from the ability to adapt the base Language Translation models to specific use cases.,Language Translation
Language Translation can be trained overtime to provide better accuracy when running translations.,Language Translation
Customizing Watson can be accomplished using the IBM Watson Language Translation Tool Beta or directly through the Watson Language Translation API.,Language Translation
Language Translation tool beta: The Language Translation tool is a web application that provides a graphical user interface to manage and train models for more accurate machine translation.,Language Translation
The beta Machine Translation and beta Language Identification APIs have been upgraded and combined into the Language Translation API.,Language Translation
"The IBM Watson Language Translation service provides an Application Programming Interface (API) that lets you select a domain, customize it, then identify or select the language of text, and then translate the text from one supported language to another.",Language Translation
You can see a quick demo of the Language Translation service in action.,Language Translation
You can submit comments or ask questions about Language Translation in the Watson forum.,Language Translation
This release features the General Availability of the customization features of the Language Translation service.,Language Translation
Migrating from the Beta Machine Translation and Language Identification APIs to the GA Language Translation API,Language Translation
The Language Translation tool is a web application that provides a graphical user interface to manage and train models for more accurate machine translation.,Language Translation
"The following image shows the process of creating a project, training a model, and translating text with the Language Translation tool:",Language Translation
The Language Translation tool is available as a web application.,Language Translation
"To log in to the tool, you must first create your credentials for the Language Translation service in Bluemix:",Language Translation
You can create several sets of user credentials so that others in your organization can access the Language Translation tool.,Language Translation
"For Language Translation, a base model is identified as the following:",Language Translation
"When you create a new project in the Language Translation tool, you can choose the source language and target language.",Language Translation
"You can provide the data to train the Language Translation service by uploading a glossary, parallel corpus, or monolingual corpus.",Language Translation
"You can use your own data to create a custom dictionary, and a custom translation model in the Language Translation API.",Language Translation
You can provide the dictionary data to train the Language Translation service by using a valid UTF-8 encoded Translation Memory Exchange (TMX) version 1.4 formatted document.,Language Translation
"The Language Translation Service uses only the <tu>, the <tuv>, and the <seg> elements.",Language Translation
"The Language Translation service uses ISO 639-1 language codes for all languages except Egyptian Arabic, which uses the ISO 639-3 code.",Language Translation
"To interact with this API, use the Language Translation Service API explorer.",Language Translation
You authenticate to the Language Translation API by providing the username and password that are provided in the service credentials for the service instance that you want to use.,Language Translation
"After creating an instance of the Language Translation service, select Service Credentials from the left navigation for its dashboard to see the username and password that are associated with that instance.",Language Translation

How to get your AppDynamics Metrics into Load Impact Test Results,Load Impact
What is Load Impacts default sleep time?,Load Impact
How can I set cookies in Load Impact?,Load Impact
Three things Load Impact is great at,Load Impact
Integrate Load Impact into your Continuous Delivery pipeline with our CI plug-ins or opt for full control with our API and SDKs.,Load Impact
"As an IBM Bluemix developer, you have the power to test your applications performance under the pressure of thousands of users at a time withLoad Impact.",Load Impact
Install and configure the Load Impact plugin for TeamCity,Load Impact
This page contains the User Agreement (Agreement) that defines the terms and conditions for your use of the online service loadimpact.com (Load Impact),Load Impact
"The Agreement is between You, the user (User), and Load Impact.",Load Impact
Your use of Load Impact constitutes your agreement to these terms and conditions.,Load Impact
Your continued use of Load Impact after the change will constitute your acceptance of the changes.,Load Impact
"You, the User, agrees to keep your Load Impact account password confidential, and only allow trusted people within your own organisation access to your Load Impact account.",Load Impact
"Load Impact agrees to always treat your account details, test configurations and test results with confidentiality and never to release this information to third parties, unless required by law to do so.",Load Impact
"Load Impact makes no guarantees on availability of individual load generator nodes, or the service as a whole",Load Impact
Load Impact will therefore not assume responsibility for individual test results.,Load Impact
"In order to create much more complex behavior from the simulated clients in a load test, you might want to take a look at the scripting functionality of Load Impact.",Load Impact
"By using the modern, high-level programming language Lua together with the Load Impact API you can make your simulated clients perform very advanced tasks on the site being tested.",Load Impact
"TheLoad Impact Chrome extensionwill capture everything  every single thing being loaded into the browser as you click  including ads, images, documents, etc., so you get a far more accurate read of whats going on.",Load Impact
"Just press record, start browsing and when complete, the script will automatically upload to your Load Impact account.",Load Impact
"To install the Load Impact plugin for TeamCity, first shutdown the TeamCity server and then copy the zip file with the plugin into the TeamCity Data/plugins directory.",Load Impact
"To configure the plugin, first you need to enter your Load Impact API token.",Load Impact
You can generate a token on the API tokenpage of your Load Impact account.,Load Impact
"To enter and validate your Load Impact API token, proceed to the administration page of your TeamCity account.",Load Impact
"To configure a build using the Load Impact plugin, first select or create a project.",Load Impact
"If you pre-configured load tests in your Load Impact account, you will now see all your saved test configurations in the drop down under Test Configuration",Load Impact
"For full test results, click on the tab Load Impact Resultsand press the button to go to your account on Load Impact.",Load Impact
"All reports, logs and test results are stored in your Load Impact account, accessible anytime.",Load Impact
"Every Load Impact user, by default, is given twoorganizations.",Load Impact
They can also access Load Impact server agent tokens and New Relic API keys.,Load Impact
"They cannotmanage billing, create projects, assign themselves or other members to projects, add/remove members from the organization, or access Load Impact API tokens.",Load Impact
Load Impacts definition of concepts and terminology,Load Impact
What IP addresses do Load Impact use to generate load?,Load Impact
How can I open my firewall to Load Impact traffic only?,Load Impact
To run tests with Load Impact they therefore need to add the Load Impact load generator IP addresses to the list of addresses that are allowed to pass the firewall.,Load Impact
"Load Impact generates load solely from the cloud, using Amazon cloud servers.",Load Impact
Load Impact uses AWS for cloud load generators.,Load Impact
"While configuring a load test schedule, you might have noticed that Load Impact automatically increases ramp-up times with increases in user load levels.",Load Impact
"-- In this particular example, we load the Load Impact main HTML page, where there is",Load Impact
-- in order to be able to do many things on the Load Impact site.,Load Impact
Monitoring New Relic Server and Application metrics in real time while running a Load Impact load test gives you a clear picture of your application and infrastructures performance under load.,Load Impact
"To add your API key to Load Impact, in the left side bar, click Integrations then ""New Relic""",Load Impact
Load Impacts basic functionality is geared towards simulating user behavior on your site in the most realistic way possible.,Load Impact
There are two ways to generate a realistic load script using Load Impact:,Load Impact
Load Impact provides an API that other applications can use to access the Load Impact platform.,Load Impact
"Your API token provides access to your Load Impact account, so do not make it public and be careful with whom you share it.",Load Impact
"You will need to use an API token (version 2) when using the Load Impact APIto programmatically manage your user scenarios, test configurations and test runs.",Load Impact
TheLoad Impact APIis commonly used whenyou need to automate your load testing efforts by integrating with,Load Impact
"Load Impact providesplugins for Jenkins and TeamCity,SDKsand examples in different programming languages.",Load Impact
Load Impact also provides a new Command line interface for the API version 3 (located at the user profile settings).,Load Impact
The version 3 API will replace the version 2 in the near future but for now it can only be used in the Load Impact CLI.,Load Impact
"Load Impactsupports both basicHTTPauthentication andHTTPPOSToperations, as well asHTTPS.",Load Impact
"Load Impact supportsHTTPPOSToperations, which mean that you mayedit your load scriptand provide the login credentials (username/password) in aPOSToperation.",Load Impact
"Load Impact automatically sets cookies when asked to by the server, so accessing pages as a logged-in user works fine if you just make sure your load script performs that initialPOSToperation.",Load Impact
Load Impact supports BasicHTTPAuthentication by the use ofURLs in this format:,Load Impact
"Load Impactmight be used by someone to run illegal load tests on a site, effectively causing a denial-of-service attack on the site in question.",Load Impact
"If you then try to start the test without performing any additional configuration, Load Impact will start an automatic test for you, running a ramp-up test at a quite low load level.",Load Impact
Load Impact basically saved our ass in being able to emulate the load and confidently report to the client that the campaign could withstand the traffic projections.,Load Impact
"POSSIBLE, a global digital agency, used Load Impact to verify that their new Windows phone application could handle up to 750,000 visitors a day.",Load Impact
They used Load Impacts On-Demand stress testing tools to emulate load and immediately saw errors in performance.,Load Impact
"The team started running performance tests using Load Impacts On Demand load testing tool, tweaked the server config and made some modifications to the code base, and almost immediately was able to run a months worth of projected user traffic - in just five minutes, without a single hiccup in performance and with zero duress on the servers, said Adam Wolf, chief technology officer in POSSIBLEs Seattle office.",Load Impact
Load Impact helped POSSIBLE build a scalable campaign and gave them the actionable data necessary to instill confidence both to the POSSIBLE team as well as the clients.,Load Impact
"Thanks to Load Impact we were confident there werent going to be any scale issues, said Wolf, who integrates load testing early and often throughout the development process.",Load Impact
Load Impact provides a Command Line Tool to convert your Postman functional tests to Load Impact load tests.,Load Impact
The following section describes the steps to convert your Postman configuration to a Load Impact configuration for running load tests.,Load Impact
The way it works is you set your browser to use aHTTPproxy located on Load Impacts servers.,Load Impact
"Load Impact provides three tools for you to get a basic script quickly; the Auto-generate feature, the Chrome Extension and the Proxy Recorder.",Load Impact
It is also used for running anonymous tests from the loadimpact.com start page by users that are not logged into Load Impact.,Load Impact
"However, it's also possible that you've only scratched the surface of performance testing with Load Impact.",Load Impact
"You can invite your team to be part of your Load Impact account to share data, run tests and create user scenarios with ourOrganizationsfeature.",Load Impact
Load Impacts service allowed us to load and stress test an advertising campaign and helped us successfully prepare for high traffic volumes,Load Impact
"JWT, one of the largest advertising agencies in the United States and the fourth-largest in the world,used Load Impactto perform load tests to verify that their new campaign site could handle up to120,000 visitors/hour.",Load Impact
"In an effort to ensure quality performance of a new campaign website built for a client in the pharmaceutical industry,Load Impactwas commissioned to establish that the backend for the website could handle the expected traffic  120,000 visitors per hour  while exhibiting load times that were within acceptable limits.",Load Impact
"When clearing your cache, though, make sure that you keep Load Impacts cookies.",Load Impact
How to get your AppDynamics metrics into Load Impact test results,Load Impact
This example shows how to get a single CPU metric into Load Impact test results using the Load Impact Server Metrics Agent.,Load Impact
1. Get your Load Impact Server Monitoring Agent and install it on your server.,Load Impact
"3. Assuming you have installed your Load Impact Server Metrics Agent on a windows box, create a powershell script containing this (named appdynamics_cpu.ps1):",Load Impact
"5. Now to the interesting part, how to get that into Load Impact!",Load Impact
"save, and recycle your server metrics agent service (its aptly named Load Impact Server Metrics Agent Service) to pick up the configuration changes.",Load Impact
"And for those of you not deploying the Load Impact Server Metrics Agent on windows but rather on a *nix this shell script (named appdynamics.sh in this example) will output the same thing as the cmdfile/powershell combo on windows (it uses curl to call the REST API, get here if you dont have it http://curl.haxx.se/):",Load Impact
"Server Monitoring helps you to measure performance metrics from your own servers and integrates these metrics with the graphs generated from your Load Impact test.This is done by installing our agents on your servers in order to grab server monitoring data, or by using our New Relic integration.",Load Impact
"In order to identify the agents when they are talking to Load Impact, we need an identification key.",Load Impact
"Next, choose ""Load Impact""",Load Impact
Load Impact is by far the easiest tool we have found for load testing our products,Load Impact
Ushahidiused Load Impact to greatly improve the performance of its software.,Load Impact
You use the Load Impact proxy recorder and set your mobile device to use that proxy when fetching HTTP(s) content from the Internet.,Load Impact
"Load Impact performed brilliantly in both consulting, service and expertise",Load Impact
Brille24used Load Impact to verify that their new E-commerce platform could handle their existing traffic levels.,Load Impact
Load Impactassisted in executing the tests during non-business hours so not many customers would be affected.,Load Impact
And how does caching work with Load Impact?,Load Impact
"Whena Load Impact load test is executed, it will start a certain number of simulated clients/users that access your site simultaneously.",Load Impact
"The Load Impact team was totally committed to the success of the project, and were super easy to work with.",Load Impact
"We expected load tests and test reports, but Load Impact really stepped up, helping to troubleshoot issues.",Load Impact
"ROKKAN, a leading digital agency based in NYC, worked with Load Impact to guarantee the stability of their client's campaign website just days ahead of their 2014 Super Bowl TV commercial.",Load Impact
"The Super Bowl Sunday challenge for ROKKAN  a 2014 Advertising Age A-List Agency for the third consecutive year  could not have been clearer: the target user load for its automaker clients microsite promoting the features of an upcoming luxury sedan, was over 250,000 visitors per hour coming in from across the country and around the world. But initial performance tests of the website using Load Impact failed far short of that goal.",Load Impact
"That first test was a total eye-opener, said Blackwelder. Load Impact showed us we had a lot of work to do to get performance where it needed to be.",Load Impact
"Note:when you are logged on with your Load Impact user account, your test results are private and visible to you only, but anyone who knows thePublicURLto a test will be able to view the same test, so be careful whom you give it to.",Load Impact
"When you run a load test using Load Impact, you will always get a default results graph on the test resultpage.",Load Impact
"Apart from native functionality of the Lua language, load script programmers can also use the Load Impact load script API to write their load scripts.",Load Impact
"This API consists of a subset of the Lua standard library, plus a number of Load Impact-specific functions and helper routines, all callable from within the Lua load script.",Load Impact

Here are the answers to several common questions about using MQ Light in Bluemix.,MQ Light
MQ Light Service for Bluemix: Encryption now supported,MQ Light
We are pleased to announce support for encryption on connections to the MQ Light service in Bluemix.,MQ Light
For cases where encryption is not required (for example because encryption is not supported by the MQ Light client API for that language) then an alternative lookup URI is provided in the nonTLSConnectionLookupURI field of VCAP_SERVICES.,MQ Light
"IBM MQ Light for Bluemixis a cloud-based messaging service, built on the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), which provides flexible and easy-to-use messaging forBluemixapps.MQ Light apps are built in a microservices framework, meaning that the services are independently deployable and scalable, and that your apps are more flexible and easier to maintain.",MQ Light
MQ Lightsupports multiple run times.,MQ Light
You can also useMQ Light to enable apps that use different run times to communicate with each other.,MQ Light
"For more information about the change, the errors it might cause, and the application modifications that are required, see MQ Light Service for Bluemix: Encryption now supported.",MQ Light
The MQ Light service enables apps that are hosted within Bluemix to connect to other apps hosted inside Bluemix.,MQ Light
Using MQ Light with AMQP 1.0 Clients,MQ Light
"As I mentioned before, MQ Light uses the OASIS Standard AMQP 1.0 wire protocol.",MQ Light
These details are needed in order to use the Proton language clients in other languages to interact with MQ Light.,MQ Light
"Using this information it is possible to use the qpid clients to send and receive messages using MQ light and the following languages: Java, Python, Ruby, Perl, PHP, C. Details of that will be in subsequent posts.",MQ Light
"The container-id field, flowed as part the clients open performative, is interpreted by MQ Light as the clients identifier. This identifier is shown in the MQ Light GUI. Note that client identifiers must be unique across an instance of the MQ Light Service.",MQ Light
"MQ Light expects the client to originate all attach performatives, and will never attempt to send attach performatives to the client. When a client sends an attach performative to the MQ Light Service the role fields is used to determine the client will use the link to send messages to the MQ Light Service (role set to false), or receive messages from the MQ Light Service (role set to true).",MQ Light
When a client is sending messages to the MQ Light Service (a producer) then the MQLight topic to which messages are sent is based on the AMQP to property of the message.,MQ Light

Compose Redis Deployments allow developers to focus on what they do best (developing useful applications) and avoid the guesswork of capacity planning.,Redis by Compose
Redis requires fast IO and as much RAM as the total data size.,Redis by Compose
"In addition to autoscaling, Redis Deployments include built-in daily backups so you can be confident that your data will never be lost.",Redis by Compose
Backups use the Redis dump command to perform the backup to ensure minimal impact to your applications.,Redis by Compose
"Automatically scaling server stack that scales RAM, CPU, and I/O as your Redis data grows.",Redis by Compose
Redis clusters consist of a master and slave member as well as Sentinels to handle node failures.,Redis by Compose
Each Redis deployment comes with a proxy to provide a single member connect string so there's no worrying with which member is currently master.,Redis by Compose
"Redis can run as a cache, setting fixed limits on memory and then managing it according to a preset policy.",Redis by Compose
"To make things simpler though, we have two basic modes, Storage and Cache, which can be selected in the console and this will set memory management rules for Redis.",Redis by Compose
"Our full range of database deployments  MongoDB with SSL, Elasticsearch, RethinkDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, etcd and RabbitMQ  are available on AWS and SoftLayer.",Redis by Compose
Redis is a simple key-value store.,Redis by Compose
"Redis is commonly used as a buffer, queue, job system, or transient database.",Redis by Compose
"A Redis update and more, Uber and its latest database migration, the road to CouchDB 2.0, Mesos reaches 1.0, a certificate manager for Kubernetes, Microsoft's ChakraCore now in Linux and OSX Node, OpenVZ goes KVM and NIST talks authentication on Gith",Redis by Compose
"For Redis, etcd and RabbitMQ, as they are memory-centric, the amount of RAM consumed is monitored.",Redis by Compose
"When a Redis deployment has consumed over 95% of its RAM, an extra unit is added to increase the available RAM (and disk storage and IOPs).",Redis by Compose
"Currently, this add-on is available for MongoDB, MongoDB+, Redis, Postgresql and Elasticsearch and billed at $4.50 per month.",Redis by Compose
"There are numerous ways to look at Redis performance without leaving the comfort of the redis-cli, such as the output from the built-in SLOWLOG command.",Redis by Compose
redis-rdb-tools will allow you to parse a Redis .rdb dump and analyze memory consumption across all databases and keys.,Redis by Compose
"redis-faina originally written by Instagram, now Facebook, can read data in realtime or from a file to generate useful stats on frequently accessed keys, key prefixes, and lengthy queries.",Redis by Compose
"Compose Redis has two modes; ""Storage"" mode is the default.",Redis by Compose
Here the auto-scaling is disabled and the Redis database does not expand.,Redis by Compose
That means it gets to rely on Redis to evict items from memory depending on what eviction policy is selected.,Redis by Compose
"With the latest updates to Redis, when 'storage' mode is selected we set the maxmemory-policy to noeviction to ensure that there is no data loss and the deployment always expands.",Redis by Compose
We don't stop you changing these settings on your deployment; they are available in the Settings page of the Compose console for your Redis deployments.,Redis by Compose
"As this the mode is an important component of how your Redis deployment works, we have also put a panel indicator on the Overview page to show which mode your deployment is operating in and we allow you to select between ""storage"" and ""cache"" when creating a new Redis deployment.",Redis by Compose
The Redis Configuration Controls allows experienced users to change a selection of Redis settings so they can tune their deployments to behave exactly as they want them.,Redis by Compose
"The design of our user interface follows the actual redis.conf configuration file, turning it into an interactive form.",Redis by Compose
That makes it easier to take application recommended configurations and apply them to your own Redis deployment.,Redis by Compose
There's no need to wait for synchronisation at the Redis level to ensure they are applied and saved.,Redis by Compose
"We'll briefly introduce each setting, but for full details of them, you'll find links to the Redis documentation for many of them by clicking on the blue circled question mark next to its name.",Redis by Compose
"As we mentioned, the sections and fields of the interface are modelled on the redis.conf configuration file and that means, where there isn't a link to the documentation, you can find more information there.",Redis by Compose
The Configuration Controls can be found in the Compose console for Redis under the Settings tab.,Redis by Compose
"At the top of the Settings view are the version and upgrade controls, then the ""Redis as a Cache"" control and then, below that are the new Configuration Controls.",Redis by Compose
"They open with the warning we've just given, that these are expert Redis settings with a link to the example Redis configuration file.",Redis by Compose
"Redis doesn't seem like a database that needs an import tool, but we've been finding Compose users who want to bring their Redis data to our platform.",Redis by Compose
"They don't just cache data in their Redis, they use it as an active reference store for applications which can be rapidly updated and, thanks to the Redis pubsub options, update clients quickly too.",Redis by Compose
"At Compose, we understand how, with Redis as an essential cog in your operations, you'd want to minimise downtime when migrating.",Redis by Compose
This is why we've created a static import tool which will import your data from a remote Redis installation into your Compose Redis deployment.,Redis by Compose
You'll find the controls in the Compose Redis console next to the Settings tab.,Redis by Compose
"Before you import a remote database, be aware that this import is going to make your Compose deployment identical to the remote database and it starts that process by clearing out your current Redis data in your deployment.",Redis by Compose
The import process does not merge the content of the two Redis databases involved.,Redis by Compose
If you have any data of value in your Compose Redis database then we recommend you create a new Redis deployment and import into that.,Redis by Compose
"What you need to import a remote Redis database is a Redis URL for it, and to have that means the remote Redis needs to be accessible on the internet.",Redis by Compose
"If you're Redis is behind a firewall, you'll need to make the appropriate arrangements to make it accessible to your Compose Redis deployment.",Redis by Compose
The Redis SLOWLOG command configures and displays the content fof a log of slow queries detected by Redis.,Redis by Compose
"On Compose Redis deployments, you've always been able to get at the results of this log from the Redis command line.",Redis by Compose
"The ""Slow Log"" feature of Compose Redis deployments allows you to view that from your Compose console on the web.",Redis by Compose
"To find the Slow log support, go to your Compose Redis console and in the sidebar menu, below the Browser button, you'll see ""Slow Log"" option.",Redis by Compose

This page lists differences between standalone Solr and the Solr-as-a-Service functionality provided by the Retrieve and Rank service.,Retrieve and Rank
Not all standard Solr operations and options are supported by the Retrieve and Rank service.,Retrieve and Rank
The units and measurements discussed in this section apply only to the Retrieve (Solr) component of the Retrieve and Rank service.,Retrieve and Rank
"Similarly, Retrieve and Rank units refer only to instances of the IBM Watson Retrieve and Rank service; at the current time there are no other Watson Developer Cloud services that use the unit/cluster sizing pattern.",Retrieve and Rank
A Retrieve and Rank cluster consists of one to 14 units on Bluemix.,Retrieve and Rank
The term cluster size in Retrieve and Rank refers to the number of units in a specific Retrieve and Rank cluster.,Retrieve and Rank
Creating a Retrieve and Rank cluster larger than the free cluster requires you to sign up for a paid service plan.,Retrieve and Rank
The free cluster you can create to test the Retrieve and Rank demo application is a single reduced-size unit consisting of a maximum of 50 MB of disk storage.,Retrieve and Rank
"You can use the Retrieve and Rank Web Interface to create a cluster and collection, upload documents and questions, and train and test rankers.",Retrieve and Rank
"When users of your application ask questions, these are the documents from which the Retrieve and Rank service searches and ranks answers.",Retrieve and Rank
The following steps walk you through getting started with Retrieve and Rank in a typical use case for the Retrieve and Rank Web Interface.,Retrieve and Rank
The tool prompts you to select a Document Conversion service instance to convert your source documents for the Retrieve and Rank service.,Retrieve and Rank
The tool prompts you to select a Retrieve and Rank service instance.,Retrieve and Rank
"If your Retrieve and Rank service instance does not already have a cluster associated with it, the tool prompts you to create a cluster by supplying a name and a size.",Retrieve and Rank
"After you have created a cluster, or if you already had a cluster in your Retrieve and Rank service instance, the tool displays the Clusters page.",Retrieve and Rank
